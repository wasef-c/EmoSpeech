No. No,1,Neutral,0,937

[LAUGHTER],1,Neutral,0,937
You know you are welcome to stay at my house if you want to just check out for a couple days and hang out.,2,Neutral,0,937

"God, I don't get it.  you know the first time we came here, you said it was the best night of your life?",0,Neutral,0,937
"Oh...well. Yeah, of course.",0,Neutral,0,937
"I will never forgive you.  All I'd done was sit around wondering if I was crazy waiting so long, wondering if you were thinking about me.",1,Happy,1,937
[LAUGHTER] And very much sillier.,1,Happy,1,937
So she wrote a lot of poetry?,0,Neutral,0,937
We flew in from Paris.  I've been shopping for three weeks.,3,Angry,3,937
It's a gift.,0,Neutral,0,937
You know.,0,Neutral,0,937
What would I do with a fortune?,1,Neutral,0,937
So I was looking at this other one and there was like a piece of candy there and I thought that I would take the candy and put it on her headstone.  And-,2,Neutral,0,937
"That's very interesting Amanda. How about a child of four?  Or a child of six?  Or a child of nine? We can get a good little conversation going on about this, you know, intemperate tots.",3,Angry,3,937
Do you want to take off your shoes?,1,Neutral,0,937
I'd rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for some things.,2,Sad,2,937
"To bring that on to the earth again, you know, is like some kind of monument and I thought I would just make a difference to them.",2,Neutral,0,937

I guess he is.,0,Neutral,0,937

Mmhmm.,0,Neutral,0,937
Don't laugh at me.  I'm being serious.,1,Happy,1,937
"Honey, this is like a natural phenomenon. I mean... People in Kansas would have to get plane reservations and get hotel rooms to see this.  It's just forty minutes away for us; it's too good to pass up.",0,Neutral,0,937
[LAUGHTER] That's really romantic.,1,Neutral,0,937
I don't care what you're freaking sign says.  Somebody- Somebody needs to replace everything I've got there and give me money for my inconvenience.,3,Angry,3,937
Yeah.,0,Neutral,0,937
maybe get a car.,0,Neutral,0,937
No.  I am just making myself fascinating for you.,3,Neutral,0,937
"And last year, I remember distinctly you said, you were so excited to get here that you don't remember you stubbed your toe until we were in the car.",0,Neutral,0,937
Yeah.,0,Neutral,0,937
I think I am not in the least bit drunk.,3,Happy,1,937
"Okay.  So I am putting out the pets, getting the car out of the garage.",0,Neutral,0,937
"Well what does it all mean?  That's what I ask myself in my quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean?",1,Happy,1,937
[LAUGHTER],1,Neutral,0,937
"I know you are Augie, I know.",2,Neutral,0,937
"Yeah.  And she was like, that's pathetic, I hope you enjoy it.",2,Neutral,0,937

Yes it is.,0,Neutral,0,937
Yeah.,0,Neutral,0,937
Pretty much all.,2,Neutral,0,937
"Because she knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my darkest moments, I think of her waiting and I know that I'm right.",3,Angry,3,937
Penny slots. That's what he plays.,0,Neutral,0,937
He's like a house manager. Yeah.  It's a good job.,0,Neutral,0,937
She is not his girl.  She knows she's not.,3,Angry,3,937
"You whispered the sweetest, most intimate things to me right into my ear so I could feel them as much as hear them.  And I remember thinking, this is it.  You know, finally, I am as happy as I'm supposed to be.",1,Happy,1,937
You ran through the sprinklers in the cemetery?,0,Neutral,0,937
He turned to you and was like...,0,Neutral,0,937
"Look, you better turn that off. I don't want to wake up the people upstairs.",3,Angry,3,937
I guess we don't need glasses.,1,Neutral,0,937
[LAUGHTER],1,Neutral,0,937
"I won't.  Let go, let go of me. Listen, listen?  I'm sick and tired of listening to you, you sadistic bully.",3,Angry,3,937
I can not-- you are not here by choice.  Nobody would ride this bus by choice.,3,Angry,3,937
"I used to go to cemeteries a lot before she died.  I just, you know, I felt like they were urban oasis, you know, there is always this green in the city.",2,Sad,2,937
"like, wait, but it's just pennies.  You're like, wait a minute I'm on to you.",0,Neutral,0,937
"God, this is great.  Think about this.  I know you are not interested, but just think about this.",1,Happy,1,937
"Uh, what?  Craig's List?  Oh the internet thing?",0,Neutral,0,937
What?,3,Neutral,0,937

Uh huh.,1,Neutral,0,937
couple hours.,2,Neutral,0,937
"But I mean she could, but it was- so it was kind of sitting at her feet holding her up and she had these poems she had memorized.  And I remember looking up, she had curly red hair and there was this palm tree right behind her and it was like a crown growing right out of her head.  It was cool.",2,Neutral,0,937
"We are actually not even allowed--  you know, like we don't have to give you this fifty dollars.  We don't have to do that.",0,Neutral,0,937
Yeah.,3,Angry,3,937
How much did he win at the slot?,0,Neutral,0,937
"No, no.",0,Neutral,0,937
"For God's sake, this is not about fish.",3,Angry,3,937
"Are there candid cameras?  Is this that movie? There's that show, right?  Airplane, airline.",3,Neutral,0,937
I have to find sitters.,0,Neutral,0,937
"There's babies over there, though, that need mothers.",0,Neutral,0,937
No.  Wrong number. [LAUGHTER],1,Neutral,0,937
"All right.  But you don't want to think like that because what the hell are we working for, Chris?  It's all for you.  This whole shooting match is for you.",3,Angry,3,937
"You'll videotape everything, yeah?",2,Neutral,0,937
"No.  You can- or you can just bring it in person.  But they need, generally, something to see, you know, what kind of what that you've done, what kind of--",0,Neutral,0,937
"We just weren't in a good spot.  I'm telling you, this is a much better spot.  I have instincts for these things.",0,Neutral,0,937
No it isn't.,3,Neutral,0,937
"Just believe with me, Joe. Only last week a man came back in Detroit missing longer than Larry.  Believe with me. You, above all, have got to believe. Just believe.",3,Angry,3,937
"Yeah. Yeah, I don't see- I don't see any--",0,Neutral,0,937
"Augie, you bought refreshments.",1,Neutral,0,937
And look what I got here.,1,Neutral,0,937
You did?,0,Neutral,0,937
"Well, what of it?",0,Neutral,0,937
"Snap, snap, snap.  You know you are like a little adder.",3,Angry,3,937
"I don't really have any imagination, that's all I know how to say.",1,Neutral,0,937
Is it a big cemetery?,0,Neutral,0,937
"Aw, geez.",2,Neutral,0,937
Okay.  Great.  I'm really sorry that you had to do that.  What's your last name?  Let's start there.,0,Neutral,0,937
You have a business here.  What the hell is this?,3,Angry,3,937
"You know, the airlines can not be held responsible for every bag of luggage that comes through here.",0,Neutral,0,937
Yeah.,2,Neutral,0,937
"It's strange; things that ought to matter dreadfully, they just don't matter at all when one's happy.  Do they?",1,Happy,1,937
"They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that, exactly.  Just a little more selfish and they would all be here today.",2,Neutral,0,937
I'm just saying I have a friend that got a good job on it so I was just recommending it.,0,Neutral,0,937
I don't know.  He had a really good resume I guess and--,0,Neutral,0,937
She needs a new name each state that we go into. [LAUGHTER],1,Happy,1,937
Fine.,0,Neutral,0,937
You know it's not just my business.,0,Neutral,0,937
I don't know.  I put in that. request too. They didn't...,2,Neutral,0,937

You started to write me.,0,Neutral,0,937
"So maybe we are in the wrong spot, but we are with the right person.",0,Neutral,0,937
Sort of embarrassed ever since I got here.,0,Neutral,0,937
"He likes to keep tabs, you know.",1,Neutral,0,937
However I believe the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.,0,Neutral,0,937
I'm a big fan of the Wheel of Fortune quarters. But it just costs so much.  I don't know.,0,Neutral,0,937
Or not.,1,Neutral,0,937
Yes it is.,0,Neutral,0,937
"I, umm. I guess, I guess that's kind of why I came.",0,Neutral,0,937
Twice is every time we have tried; that's ever.,3,Angry,3,937
Every day since.,1,Neutral,0,937
Who knows?,1,Neutral,0,937

What am I going to do? Huh?,2,Neutral,0,937
How long were you there for?,0,Neutral,0,937
They are away in Tunis.,0,Neutral,0,937
Well maybe...maybe he just wanted to see her.,0,Neutral,0,937
Who's in charge?  Who is the president of Jet Blue?,3,Angry,3,937
Four o clock this morning.  I heard a crack and I woke up and looked out.  He was standing right over there when it cracked.,0,Neutral,0,937
beating around the bush.,1,Angry,3,937
About what?,0,Neutral,0,937
So what's up?  What's new?,0,Neutral,0,937
I'm beginning to think this might be the right spot after all.,1,Neutral,0,937
"I don't understand.  You've already done so much, I don't know why do you have to go back.",2,Sad,2,937
Oh.  I hadn't even thought about that.,1,Neutral,0,937
"Hmm.  I noticed that, it's pretty. Big old white moon.",1,Neutral,0,937
I didn't say that.,0,Neutral,0,937
Mind your own business.,3,Angry,3,937
Yes.  Meaning just that.,1,Neutral,0,937
Fine if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.,3,Angry,3,937
Oh.  That's very amusing indeed.,3,Angry,3,937
At the cemetery?,2,Neutral,0,937
"The flashlight, the silver one.  There's only one, isn't there?",0,Neutral,0,937
"Oh really.  It's a pity you didn't have any brandy, it would have made you a little less disagreeable.",3,Angry,3,937
Can I help you?,1,Neutral,0,937
"You are far too temperamental, try to control yourself.",3,Angry,3,937
So I was like wandering around before.  It takes forever to find her headstone; I always lose it. You know.,2,Neutral,0,937
"Oh See, I don't care what you do, see.  You can paint yourself green and run naked through the Place Vendome and run off with all of the men of the world.  I shan't say a word, just as long as you love me best.",1,Happy,1,937
I just want you to know Annie.,0,Neutral,0,937
Yeah.,0,Neutral,0,937
Just don't think like that.,3,Angry,3,937
Yeah.,0,Neutral,0,937
"Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.  Oh laugh, laugh all you like but why does this happen the very night he comes back.  She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look at it, Joe, look.",3,Angry,3,937
"Of course, our flashlight.  What's yours is mine.  Me flashlight es su flashlight.",0,Neutral,0,937
"Or you can make a phone call.  But I think a letter might be a little more-- in my impression, letters have more...",0,Neutral,0,937
"Am I going to be getting, like, free tickets, free mileage. When can I expect my bag here?",3,Neutral,0,937
"I'm sorry, Joy.",2,Sad,2,937
Mmhmm.,0,Neutral,0,937
I almost got married two years ago.,0,Neutral,0,937
"Just, you know, kicking myself.",2,Neutral,0,937

Oh shut up.,3,Angry,3,937
Well so now we're married. We have cat children.,1,Happy,1,937

Yes.,0,Neutral,0,937
"I'll have a little, I think.",0,Neutral,0,937
Turn it off.,3,Angry,3,937

Uh huh.,0,Neutral,0,937

"Yeah.  But the piece of paper helps, too.",0,Neutral,0,937
I don't think you have done everything you could do because I don't have my bag here yet.,3,Angry,3,937
