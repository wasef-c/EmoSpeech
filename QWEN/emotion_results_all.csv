What of it?,0,Neutral,0,940
And I went to work with dad and that rat race again. And I felt what you said-ashamed somehow. Because nobody was changed at all. It seemed to make a sucker out of a lot of guys.,2,Sad,2,939
"You think that things get easier, you know, as you as you get older and you -",2,Neutral,0,944

Actually that's perfectly true.,0,Neutral,0,941
"Honey, I'm going to come back. It's not like that.",2,Sad,2,939

The airline can't afford to give you everything that is in that suitcase. and so-,0,Neutral,0,940
This happens every two weeks?,0,Neutral,0,944

Yeah.,0,Neutral,0,937
"Laugh.  Laugh at me, but what happens the night that she goes to sleep in his bed, and his memorial breaks in pieces?",3,Angry,3,943
'Cause you can take those things out of a war.  But you have to realize that those things came out of the love that a man can have for another man...,2,Neutral,0,945
"My worst times I think about her, you know, and I",2,Sad,2,941
It's a pity you didn't have any more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.,3,Angry,3,942

"Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing, love?",0,Neutral,0,942
"If you're- if you're- if you're looking for a lawsuit, baby, you've found it.",3,Angry,3,937
"Do you think that I thought there would be times when you would look at me like I was used Kleenex or I would look at you and think, good God, when's the next flight to Alaska?  No.  No, I'm just like you. I thought it would all be like peaches and roses, and sand in our toes, and wind in our hair, and the fish would always come.  And the bills would magically pay themselves.  And we'd have three fat rosy kids.  But, ha ha, baby, the jokes on us!",3,Angry,3,944
"Aw, geez.",2,Neutral,0,937

Umm...,2,Neutral,0,945
"So why don't we just do that and stop this nonsense, hmm?  Hmm?",3,Angry,3,942

Was it an accident?,0,Neutral,0,945
"We're all right, aren't we, darling, whatever happens?",0,Neutral,0,944
"Huh.  Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  No?  you know, we should have brought the blanket?  Our blanket.",0,Neutral,0,937
Uh huh.  I didn't come here get in yelling match either.,0,Angry,3,945
Okay? Thank you for calling.  Goodbye.,0,Neutral,0,939
It was and then I went home.  And it was incredible.  It didn't have any meaning there.,2,Neutral,0,944
You still feel that way?,2,Neutral,0,938
This is a big night for these little guys.  It's like life's last orgy.,0,Neutral,0,937

"No.  I'm beginning to think you might be right. I think  this might be the spot after all.  Augie, I'm sorry.",1,Sad,2,944
"They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today.",2,Neutral,0,938
You're not going like this.,3,Angry,3,940
"No, you have to buy it now.  It's like thirty dollar extra.",0,Neutral,0,944
"If yeah, well if you just slow down we'll um, we'll definitely have your problem solved and after we have your problem solved, then I can transfer you to a manager, someone who can you know, you can voice your complaint to, who will be able to something about it.",0,Neutral,0,943
