Well I lost them.,2,Neutral,0,937
Right.,0,Neutral,0,937

This is a big night for these little guys.  It's like life's last orgy.,0,Neutral,0,937
"I know.  It kind of went out of style, didn't it?",0,Neutral,0,937
"Nobody in this house dares take away her faith, Joe.  You know strangers might, but not his father, not his brother.",3,Angry,3,937
It's not so bad; it's a good thing.,0,Neutral,0,937
"No, no.",0,Neutral,0,937

How long were you there for?,0,Neutral,0,937
[BREATHING],0,Neutral,0,937
You know Larry is not coming back and I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?,0,Sad,2,937
There are no people upstairs; it's a photographer's studio.,0,Neutral,0,937
Hmm.,0,Neutral,0,937
I'll send you lots of letters.,2,Neutral,0,937
And then we'll thrash it out with father.  Okay Mom?  Don't avoid me.,0,Neutral,0,937

"I remember, too, when we were--  she died at U.C.L.A.  She had brain surgery and there was not much hope to begin with, but I gave blood for her surgery, her mom and I before, so we dropped her off in the waiting room and then we were giving blood and came back.  And she, in her wheelchair, like can hardly do anything, reciting her poetry for these people like in the waiting room.  All she needs is a God damn audience.  You know?",2,Sad,2,937
No.  There's regular jobs on there.,0,Neutral,0,937
"Don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that, you always ask me that.  It's insulting.",3,Angry,3,937
Don't you guys have access to computers over there.,0,Neutral,0,937
"Or you can make a phone call.  But I think a letter might be a little more-- in my impression, letters have more...",0,Neutral,0,937
So what's up?  What's new?,0,Neutral,0,937
Yeah.  Do you want to see my supervisor?  Huh? Yeah.  Do you want to see my supervisor?  Fine.  I'll be right back.,3,Angry,3,937

I went to see her headstone a week or two ago.,2,Neutral,0,937
"There's babies over there, though, that need mothers.",0,Neutral,0,937
That's fair enough.,0,Neutral,0,937
Well so now we're married. We have cat children.,1,Happy,1,937
Okay.  Great.  I'm really sorry that you had to do that.  What's your last name?  Let's start there.,0,Neutral,0,937
"What is going on here, Joe?",3,Angry,3,937
You know it's not just my business.,0,Neutral,0,937
"I don't see any record of it, and I-usually when I don't see a record of it, that means um-",0,Neutral,0,937
I know.,0,Neutral,0,937
"Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men, why is she still single?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she waited.",3,Angry,3,937
That's sweet.,0,Neutral,0,937
Yeah.  I suppose I have been. But it's going from me.,2,Neutral,0,937
Ahh...we weren't in a good spot.,0,Neutral,0,937
"Yeah.  And she was like, that's pathetic, I hope you enjoy it.",2,Neutral,0,937
"Huh.  Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  No?  you know, we should have brought the blanket?  Our blanket.",0,Neutral,0,937

She used to have these poetry parties on Memorial Day.,2,Sad,2,937
Yeah.,0,Neutral,0,937
Oh.  Yes I am.,3,Neutral,0,937
Hmm.,0,Neutral,0,937
"Of course, right.  That's where the real money is, being a student.",0,Neutral,0,937
Yeah.,0,Neutral,0,937
"Sit down, Mom.  I want to talk to you.",0,Neutral,0,937
"Presents?  It was only a trivial, little brooch.",1,Happy,1,937
"I guess, you know, everybody has to make sacrifices.",0,Neutral,0,937
"No.  But it has an outline, you know.",0,Neutral,0,937
"All right.  But you don't want to think like that because what the hell are we working for, Chris?  It's all for you.  This whole shooting match is for you.",3,Angry,3,937
Yeah.  But this..this moment on the beach is like the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping around is laying eggs or what to do - spawning or mating or whatever.,0,Neutral,0,937
Do you want me to go get some champagne?,0,Neutral,0,937
What would I do with a fortune?,1,Neutral,0,937
So she wrote a lot of poetry?,0,Neutral,0,937
you know what?  I heard about that job.  I applied for that.,0,Neutral,0,937
"I feel like I'm always just standing here waiting.  I feel like this night is going to be the night, but it never is.",2,Sad,2,937
Give me a...,1,Neutral,0,937
What am I going to do? Huh?,2,Neutral,0,937
So I was looking at this other one and there was like a piece of candy there and I thought that I would take the candy and put it on her headstone.  And-,2,Neutral,0,937
She needs a new name each state that we go into. [LAUGHTER],1,Happy,1,937
"this woman came up and, you know, it was hers. It was her person that was there.",0,Neutral,0,937
Fifty bucks. Mmhmm.,0,Neutral,0,937
Sort of embarrassed ever since I got here.,0,Neutral,0,937
It's kind of helpful when getting a job.,0,Neutral,0,937
Well then you'll wake up the people downstairs.,3,Neutral,0,937
I don't care what you're freaking sign says.  Somebody- Somebody needs to replace everything I've got there and give me money for my inconvenience.,3,Angry,3,937
About what I was saying.,0,Neutral,0,937
"for such an inconvenience and your bag, but",0,Neutral,0,937
Well then maybe you can just call him and he can give you more money.  But right now all I can do--,0,Neutral,0,937
I don't know.,0,Neutral,0,937
[LAUGHTER],1,Neutral,0,937
"You are a vile, ill-tempered, loose living, wicked little beast and I never want to see you again as long as I live.",3,Angry,3,937
I'm going to ask her to marry me.,0,Neutral,0,937
No.,2,Neutral,0,937
[BREATHING],1,Neutral,0,937

"But the pennies always get you because you end up spending like, you know, fifty bucks.",0,Neutral,0,937
I guess we don't need glasses.,1,Neutral,0,937
[LAUGHTER] I'll never forget his face. [LAUGHTER],1,Happy,1,937
"Uh, I think seven hundred and fifty dollars.",0,Neutral,0,937
I just- I know I don't make you happy.,2,Sad,2,937
You've always had a weak head.,3,Angry,3,937
Who do you think you are?,3,Angry,3,937
You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.,0,Neutral,0,937
"Maybe you can send it to me, like stream it, yeah?",2,Neutral,0,937
"I don't really have any imagination, that's all I know how to say.",1,Neutral,0,937

I kissed you.,1,Neutral,0,937
"Really, Amanda.",3,Angry,3,937
Is this a joke?,3,Angry,3,937

How many?,0,Neutral,0,937
"And then, you.  You've been kind of...",0,Neutral,0,937
"That's good.  Don't you have to like teach a class, too, when you do that?",0,Neutral,0,937
"You'll videotape everything, yeah?",2,Neutral,0,937

They are away in Tunis.,0,Neutral,0,937

Mmhmm.,0,Neutral,0,937
things just aren't what they seem.,2,Neutral,0,937
How do you know he's even thinking about it?,0,Neutral,0,937

"The bus, I'm riding the bus because I want to.",3,Angry,3,937
You ran through the sprinklers in the cemetery?,0,Neutral,0,937
It was at the slot machines.,1,Happy,1,937

I have to find sitters.,0,Neutral,0,937
I know.,0,Neutral,0,937
You've been looking for a job for a long time; that was a long time ago.  Right?,0,Neutral,0,937

And I said, sure great, let's go.",0,Neutral,0,937
