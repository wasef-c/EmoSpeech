You have a business here.  What the hell is this?,3,Angry,3,937
Is this a joke?,3,Angry,3,937

This is no time of year for Tunis.,0,Neutral,0,937
[BREATHING],1,Neutral,0,937
"On the contrary, a child of two can get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.",3,Angry,3,937
You can't just toss off a thing like that because they weren't just men. You know?,2,Sad,2,937
He saw it.,0,Neutral,0,937
Yeah.  I know.,2,Neutral,0,937
Okay.  I'll do that.,3,Neutral,0,937
"If you're- if you're- if you're looking for a lawsuit, baby, you've found it.",3,Angry,3,937

So I was looking at this other one and there was like a piece of candy there and I thought that I would take the candy and put it on her headstone.  And-,2,Neutral,0,937
I'm just saying I have a friend that got a good job on it so I was just recommending it.,0,Neutral,0,937
This is a big night for these little guys.  It's like life's last orgy.,0,Neutral,0,937

Can I help you?,1,Neutral,0,937
Like you need another one of those.[LAUGHTER],1,Neutral,0,937
"Uhuh, uhuh.  He won big and he-and he realized that the only thing that would make it better was me as his bride.",1,Happy,1,937
Excuse me.,0,Neutral,0,937
"Yeah, sure.",0,Neutral,0,937
"No, no.",0,Neutral,0,937
"We just weren't in a good spot.  I'm telling you, this is a much better spot.  I have instincts for these things.",0,Neutral,0,937
Shut up.,3,Angry,3,937
Oh.  It's a woman's duty to allure the man.,3,Angry,3,937
What shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us.[LAUGHTER],1,Neutral,0,937
What am I going to do? Huh?,2,Neutral,0,937
"Yes I did, quite a lot.",3,Angry,3,937
"I don't see any record of it, and I-usually when I don't see a record of it, that means um-",0,Neutral,0,937
Yeah.  I heard.,0,Neutral,0,937
"Maybe if you were with someone else, too.",2,Neutral,0,937
"Well as a matter of fact, yes, that's perfectly true.",0,Neutral,0,937
"And then, you.  You've been kind of...",0,Neutral,0,937
And I want lots and lots and lots of pictures.,2,Neutral,0,937
I won't stand for any nonsense.,3,Angry,3,937
"No, no.  This is real.",0,Neutral,0,937
"It's when we were driving past that Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, let's get some champagne.  I said no, time's a wasting or something like that.",0,Neutral,0,937
"For God- Grow up, Augie.  The fish are not going to arrive.",3,Angry,3,937
I don't know.  Isn't that-- that's all like escort services and things like that.,0,Neutral,0,937
Oh.  She was there?,0,Neutral,0,937
He was out here when it broke.,0,Neutral,0,937
"I used to go to cemeteries a lot before she died.  I just, you know, I felt like they were urban oasis, you know, there is always this green in the city.",2,Sad,2,937
Yes.  Meaning just that.,1,Neutral,0,937
I'm not frustrated.,3,Neutral,0,937
I have to find sitters.,0,Neutral,0,937
No.  I am just making myself fascinating for you.,3,Neutral,0,937
"That's good.  Don't you have to like teach a class, too, when you do that?",0,Neutral,0,937
I went to see her headstone a week or two ago.,2,Neutral,0,937
Oh-Oh.  It's a gift.  You're-You're helping me out here?,3,Angry,3,937
How do you know he's even thinking about it?,0,Neutral,0,937
[LAUGHTER],1,Neutral,0,937
I'm cold.,2,Neutral,0,937
"You know, the airlines can not be held responsible for every bag of luggage that comes through here.",0,Neutral,0,937
Don't laugh at me.  I'm being serious.,1,Happy,1,937
"And I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more than, too. Yes.  I suppose you guys had a riotous time, huh?  All out, no restraint at all.  Well, you never really had much anyhow.",3,Angry,3,937
Yeah.  But this..this moment on the beach is like the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping around is laying eggs or what to do - spawning or mating or whatever.,0,Neutral,0,937
That's fair enough.,0,Neutral,0,937
[LAUGHTER],1,Neutral,0,937
How much did he win at the slot?,0,Neutral,0,937
"I brought- I brought Chuck with me. He went to Redlands, yeah, for the day.  We ran through the sprinklers.",0,Neutral,0,937
"And the last time before she died, I remember she couldn't really stand, umm...",2,Sad,2,937
Pretty much all.,2,Neutral,0,937
"Am I going to be getting, like, free tickets, free mileage. When can I expect my bag here?",3,Neutral,0,937
I don't think I'm anyone.,0,Neutral,0,937
Don't you guys have access to computers over there.,0,Neutral,0,937
"Okay.  So I am putting out the pets, getting the car out of the garage.",0,Neutral,0,937
Is there a problem?,0,Neutral,0,937
You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.,0,Neutral,0,937
I think I mentioned once before that I've had three minute liquor glasses the whole evening long.  A child of two cannot get drunk on that.,3,Angry,3,937
He's like a manager for a theatre.,0,Neutral,0,937
You are cruising for a bruising.  You are in so much trouble.,3,Angry,3,937
You know.,0,Neutral,0,937
Well Vegas was awesome.,1,Neutral,0,937
So what do you think?,1,Neutral,0,937
No.,0,Neutral,0,937
"We are actually not even allowed--  you know, like we don't have to give you this fifty dollars.  We don't have to do that.",0,Neutral,0,937
She needs a new name each state that we go into. [LAUGHTER],1,Happy,1,937
"I know.  It kind of went out of style, didn't it?",0,Neutral,0,937
"All right.  But you don't want to think like that because what the hell are we working for, Chris?  It's all for you.  This whole shooting match is for you.",3,Angry,3,937
"Well what does it all mean?  That's what I ask myself in my quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean?",1,Happy,1,937
You've been looking for a job for a long time; that was a long time ago.  Right?,0,Neutral,0,937
"Oh shut up.  Let go.  I hate you, I hate you.  Do you hear?  You are a conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible.",3,Angry,3,937
I guess he is.,0,Neutral,0,937
What about me?,3,Neutral,0,937
"for such an inconvenience and your bag, but",0,Neutral,0,937
Oh.  Yes I am.,3,Neutral,0,937
"You whispered the sweetest, most intimate things to me right into my ear so I could feel them as much as hear them.  And I remember thinking, this is it.  You know, finally, I am as happy as I'm supposed to be.",1,Happy,1,937
Yeah.,0,Neutral,0,937
And very much sillier.,1,Neutral,0,937
How long were you there for?,0,Neutral,0,937
They sting. I don't care.  Do you understand?  I don't care if they bark and they roll about like hoops.,3,Angry,3,937
"Uh, what?  Craig's List?  Oh the internet thing?",0,Neutral,0,937
Twice is every time we have tried; that's ever.,3,Angry,3,937
"He likes to keep tabs, you know.",1,Neutral,0,937
"So maybe we are in the wrong spot, but we are with the right person.",0,Neutral,0,937
"Not very funny, darling.  Why don't you have some more brandy.",3,Sad,2,937
Is this a Masters or a P.h.D.?  Or can you...? Nice,0,Neutral,0,937
"Shh.  If we're very quiet, the fish might come.",0,Neutral,0,937
"Don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that, you always ask me that.  It's insulting.",3,Angry,3,937
Yes it is.,0,Neutral,0,937
I think I am not in the least bit drunk.,3,Happy,1,937
Oh shut up.,3,Angry,3,937
Yeah.  Do you want to see my supervisor?  Huh? Yeah.  Do you want to see my supervisor?  Fine.  I'll be right back.,3,Angry,3,937
[LAUGHTER],1,Neutral,0,937
Yeah.,0,Neutral,0,937
It's a gift.,0,Neutral,0,937
"I don't understand.  You've already done so much, I don't know why do you have to go back.",2,Sad,2,937
beating around the bush.,1,Angry,3,937
That's out of control.,3,Angry,3,937
"The bus, I'm riding the bus because I want to.",3,Angry,3,937
Thank you.,0,Neutral,0,937
"Yeah.  Well.  You know, because he's leaving the next day.",1,Neutral,0,937
No it isn't.,3,Neutral,0,937
What?,3,Neutral,0,937
She is not his girl.  She knows she's not.,3,Angry,3,937
"Of course, our flashlight.  What's yours is mine.  Me flashlight es su flashlight.",0,Neutral,0,937
"You know, actually now that you mention it, no I don't.",0,Neutral,0,937
Okay. Calm-,0,Angry,3,937
Umm. Yeah.,2,Neutral,0,937
"Oh really.  It's a pity you didn't have any brandy, it would have made you a little less disagreeable.",3,Angry,3,937
You're not.,3,Neutral,0,937
I don't know.,2,Neutral,0,937
"About all of that, about all I was talking about.",1,Neutral,0,937
Well then you'll wake up the people downstairs.,3,Neutral,0,937
So she wrote a lot of poetry?,0,Neutral,0,937
Yes.  One less car at a time.,0,Neutral,0,937
[LAUGHTER] That's really romantic.,1,Neutral,0,937
"I want you to-- I want you to act like he is coming back, both of you.  Don't think I haven't noticed you since Chris invited her here.",3,Angry,3,937
"Presents?  It was only a trivial, little brooch.",1,Happy,1,937
Hi.  Thanks for waiting.,0,Neutral,0,937
"Clearly.  You know, do you have like a supervisor or something?",0,Neutral,0,937
Uh huh.,0,Neutral,0,937
"They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that, exactly.  Just a little more selfish and they would all be here today.",2,Neutral,0,937
I knew they would.,0,Neutral,0,937
"To bring that on to the earth again, you know, is like some kind of monument and I thought I would just make a difference to them.",2,Neutral,0,937
"But I mean she could, but it was- so it was kind of sitting at her feet holding her up and she had these poems she had memorized.  And I remember looking up, she had curly red hair and there was this palm tree right behind her and it was like a crown growing right out of her head.  It was cool.",2,Neutral,0,937
About what I was saying.,0,Neutral,0,937
I'd rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for some things.,2,Sad,2,937
No.,0,Neutral,0,937
"Wait, that's my point, too.",0,Neutral,0,937
Do you want to get married again?,1,Neutral,0,937
"Or you can make a phone call.  But I think a letter might be a little more-- in my impression, letters have more...",0,Neutral,0,937
Oh Come and kiss me darling before your body rots and worms pop out of your eye sockets.,1,Neutral,0,937
"I'll get out.  I'll get married and I'll move somewhere else, maybe New York.",0,Neutral,0,937
Mind your own business.,3,Angry,3,937
Mmhmm.,0,Neutral,0,937
Because I probably know him.,3,Neutral,0,937
"Okay.  So you were fine during that phone call from Marge and then dinner was okay.  And doing the dishes was fine and then I was going to take a shower and you're watching the news and you said the grunions are running tonight, do you want to go?  And I said, sure great, let's go.",0,Neutral,0,937
Yeah.,0,Neutral,0,937
I don't even know how to start.,2,Sad,2,937
"Well sure, from your mother's point of view.  Why else would I come?",0,Neutral,0,937
"Hey, let's drive some place.  Huh?  Let's get out of here.",2,Neutral,0,937
"Like for instance, there was this one time it had been raining for several days and this kid he just came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks.  He just put them in my pocket.  That's a little thing, you know, but that's what kind of guys I had.",2,Sad,2,937
"But then I came home and it was incredible, you know?  The whole thing was just kind of this random bus accident.  You know, I went back to the rat race again, I went to work.",2,Neutral,0,937
Yeah.,0,Neutral,0,937
Ahh...we weren't in a good spot.,0,Neutral,0,937
Right.,0,Neutral,0,937
You're the only one who still loves his parents.,0,Neutral,0,937
I'm a big fan of the Wheel of Fortune quarters. But it just costs so much.  I don't know.,0,Neutral,0,937
"Maybe you can send it to me, like stream it, yeah?",2,Neutral,0,937
I don't know.,0,Neutral,0,937
Yeah.,0,Neutral,0,937
"Nobody in this house dares take away her faith, Joe.  You know strangers might, but not his father, not his brother.",3,Angry,3,937
"Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.  Oh laugh, laugh all you like but why does this happen the very night he comes back.  She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look at it, Joe, look.",3,Angry,3,937
Just give it some more thought.,0,Neutral,0,937
I kissed you.,1,Neutral,0,937
Okay.,0,Neutral,0,937
You ran through the sprinklers in the cemetery?,0,Neutral,0,937
"And last year, I remember distinctly you said, you were so excited to get here that you don't remember you stubbed your toe until we were in the car.",0,Neutral,0,937
And look what I got here.,1,Neutral,0,937
About what?,0,Neutral,0,937
I almost got married two years ago.,0,Neutral,0,937
Oh.  That's very amusing indeed.,3,Angry,3,937
I don't understand why this is so complicated for people when they get here.  It's just a simple form.  I just need an ID.,3,Angry,3,937
What would I do with a fortune?,1,Neutral,0,937
"It's just all mixed up with so many other things, you know?  You know overseas I was in command of a company?",2,Neutral,0,937
Oh.  I hadn't even thought about that.,1,Neutral,0,937
"But the pennies always get you because you end up spending like, you know, fifty bucks.",0,Neutral,0,937
I don't care what you're freaking sign says.  Somebody- Somebody needs to replace everything I've got there and give me money for my inconvenience.,3,Angry,3,937
"There's babies over there, though, that need mothers.",0,Neutral,0,937
Yeah.  Do you have a resume?,0,Neutral,0,937
With the amount of--,0,Neutral,0,937
"Augie, you bought refreshments.",1,Neutral,0,937
[BREATHING],1,Neutral,0,937
"I, umm. I guess, I guess that's kind of why I came.",0,Neutral,0,937
No.  Wrong number. [LAUGHTER],1,Neutral,0,937
"I just, you know, think you should try a little harder maybe.",0,Neutral,0,937
"Are there candid cameras?  Is this that movie? There's that show, right?  Airplane, airline.",3,Neutral,0,937
"Does that mean that you're going to get citizenship, too, in- in England or whatever?",0,Neutral,0,937
Mmhmm.,0,Neutral,0,937
Whose is it?,0,Neutral,0,937
Yes.,0,Neutral,0,937
Do they always run during a full moon?  I don't remember.  Was it full last year?,0,Neutral,0,937
Mmhmm.,0,Neutral,0,937
Yeah.,2,Neutral,0,937
"Well, what of it?",0,Neutral,0,937
Oh.  Must you be inspired?,3,Angry,3,937
Turn it off.,3,Angry,3,937
Every day since.,1,Neutral,0,937
You've always had a weak head.,3,Angry,3,937
"Have you tried, uh, Craig's List?",0,Neutral,0,937
"Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men, why is she still single?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she waited.",3,Angry,3,937
I didn't say that.,0,Neutral,0,937
I can not-- you are not here by choice.  Nobody would ride this bus by choice.,3,Angry,3,937
"God, this is great.  Think about this.  I know you are not interested, but just think about this.",1,Happy,1,937
No.,2,Neutral,0,937
She used to have these poetry parties on Memorial Day.,2,Sad,2,937
"For God's sake, this is not about fish.",3,Angry,3,937
Last month--  Yeah.,2,Neutral,0,937
"Just, you know, kicking myself.",2,Neutral,0,937
What?,0,Neutral,0,937
Oh.  You knew there was nothing in that.,1,Neutral,0,937
Penny slots. That's what he plays.,0,Neutral,0,937
No.  There's regular jobs on there.,0,Neutral,0,937
"Some, I guess.  She memorized this one, John Dunn, it's called, Death Be Not Proud. and-",2,Neutral,0,937
You keep saying my flashlight like it's just yours.,3,Angry,3,937
"Yeah. Yeah, I don't see- I don't see any--",0,Neutral,0,937
It's got that about it.,3,Neutral,0,937
Flight seven fourteen.,3,Neutral,0,937
This is the end.  Do you hear me?  Finally and forever.,3,Angry,3,937
I know.,0,Neutral,0,937
I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.,0,Neutral,0,937
"Shut up. Shut up. God, I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling back to me on a bended knee.  You are a vile, ill-tempered, mean little wench and I never want to see you again as long as I live.",3,Angry,3,937
Why not?,0,Neutral,0,937
"Oh...well. Yeah, of course.",0,Neutral,0,937
Okay.  Great.  I'm really sorry that you had to do that.  What's your last name?  Let's start there.,0,Neutral,0,937
Yeah.,0,Neutral,0,937
"Sit down, Mom.  I want to talk to you.",0,Neutral,0,937
Not particularly.,0,Neutral,0,937
"The flashlight, the silver one.  There's only one, isn't there?",0,Neutral,0,937
"No.  But it has an outline, you know.",0,Neutral,0,937
"That was a rouser, wasn't it?",1,Happy,1,937
Mmhmm.,0,Neutral,0,937
I just want you to know Annie.,0,Neutral,0,937
"What is going on here, Joe?",3,Angry,3,937
Well.,0,Neutral,0,937
Yeah.,3,Angry,3,937
What the hell is this?,3,Angry,3,937
"My best friend Heather.  She's got a- we have a- we built this like little--  There's a park, Prospect Park.  And there is like a garden section of it that we set up for her.",2,Neutral,0,937
Yeah.,0,Neutral,0,937
And I didn't want any of it. I guess that included you.,2,Sad,2,937
"Honey, this is like a natural phenomenon. I mean... People in Kansas would have to get plane reservations and get hotel rooms to see this.  It's just forty minutes away for us; it's too good to pass up.",0,Happy,1,937
I'm going to ask her to marry me.,0,Neutral,0,937
"I know you meant this to be special, I know that you wanted it to be right, but I just can't help thinking that, I can't help wishing that I was somewhere else.",2,Sad,2,937
No.,0,Neutral,0,937
"Because she knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my darkest moments, I think of her waiting and I know that I'm right.",3,Angry,3,937
Yeah.,0,Neutral,0,937
You are so high and mighty.  I just--,3,Neutral,0,937
"The manager came in, he found us rolling about the floor, biting and scratching like panthers. [LAUGHTER]  How utterly, utterly ridiculous.",1,Angry,3,937
They are away in Tunis.,0,Neutral,0,937
It was at the slot machines.,1,Happy,1,937
Hmm.,0,Neutral,0,937
That's the wind.,0,Neutral,0,937
"I feel like I'm always just standing here waiting.  I feel like this night is going to be the night, but it never is.",2,Sad,2,937
"Am I embarrassing you? Are you - See, I didn't want to do it here with this yard, on this porch.  I wanted it to be somewhere new, some place fresh for both of us.",1,Neutral,0,937
I just don't know how I'm going to do it without you.,2,Sad,2,937
Do you want to go home?  Are you cold?,0,Neutral,0,937
"[BREATHING] You know, it's lovely here.  The air is sweet.",0,Neutral,0,937
"I will never forgive you.  All I'd done was sit around wondering if I was crazy waiting so long, wondering if you were thinking about me.",1,Happy,1,937
"Right now all I can do is just give you this fifty dollars, I'm really sorry.",0,Sad,2,937
That's the wind.,0,Neutral,0,937
I just don't see why it has to be you.,2,Neutral,0,937
Is that your phone?,1,Neutral,0,937
Well maybe we should sit down some time and you can just tell me all the stuff that you have done and I'll write it out.,0,Neutral,0,937
"No.  I'm just giving you money, the bag is gone.  If it's not here, I'm really sorry there is nothing I can do because...",0,Neutral,0,937
And then we'll thrash it out with father.  Okay Mom?  Don't avoid me.,0,Neutral,0,937
Well then maybe you can just call him and he can give you more money.  But right now all I can do--,0,Neutral,0,937
